<h4>College</h4>
<p1>
I am currently an undergraduate student in the Business School. My classes have mostly been centered around Marketing including the required finance, accounting, and businss analytics classes. However, since adding on the Digital Studies Certificate, I have been able to take more exciting classes including Intro to Digital Forms and Intro to Digital Media Production. I am very happy that I added on digital studies because it has given me an opportunity to learn more about the digital world and its connection to Marketing.

<h4>Hometown</h4>
<p>
Prior to moving to Wisconsin, I grew up in <strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong> where I graduated high school at Brentwood School. Although I miss the warm weather, the move to the midwest has overall been a positive experience. I really enjoy the people here and the relationships I have built as the people are extrmeley kind and genuine. I am very lucky to have had the opportunity to move away for college!
</p>

	
<p>
That being said, some of my favorite things to do at home include:
	<ul>
		<li>Spending quality time with friends and family</li>
		<li>Hanging out with my dogs</li>
		<li>Going to the beach</li>
		<li>Trying new restaurants</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Passions</h4>
<p>
I am also very passionate about doing volunteer work within my community. Camp Kesem is one of the student organizations I am involved in on campus. This special organization helps children through and beyond their parents' cancer. Although we host a week-long summer camp in which campers can attend for free, we also host events and reach out to our campers throughout the year. In addition, we focus on fundraising during the year. We fundraise on Giving Tuesday as well as through our biggest fundraising event called <strong>Make the Magic</strong>. This year I am a Make the Magic Coordinator, which means that I get to help plan and execute Make the Magic 2022. I cannot wait to see the night come to life as well as have the event in person again!
